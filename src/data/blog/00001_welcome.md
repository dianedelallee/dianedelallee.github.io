## Motivation

A new year is always a good time to make an introspection, setting new challenge, new goal and also a opportunity to change some old habits.

My previous website was not really up to date, so I decided to start from scratch and create a new one more adequate to my current needs.

It is also a great opportunity to test a new framework -> so I decided to play with [astro](https://astro.build/)

## What will change

Off course, there is a new design for the website, but the content will be also different. I would like to journaling more, so this space will be the opportunity to practice.

Some topics I would like to cover:
- Organisation
- Self Development
- Photography
- Gardening (cause I'm a plant lover and I bought on orchad recently) 
- Code and programming

and probably other topics that will come to my mind.

I wish you a good reading and hope you will enjoy the content I will share with you.
