## Introduction

For several years now, I have been using a bullet journal to organize my life.
It helps me to keep track of my goals, my habits, my appointments, and my tasks. 
It is an inspirational tools that helps me focusing on what is important to me at a specific moment.

After several years of trying different setup this is my setup for 2025

## Setup

- Moleskine weekly notebook A6
- Moleskine Dotted notebook A5
- pencil case with several pens and color pencils
- some stickers and washi tape
- a small ruller that fit in my A5 notebook

## How I use it

### Weekly notebook
on the left there is the week overview and on the right there is a space for notes.

On each day, I will only write the important meeting I have or the event I plan to attend.
On the right side, I will only note my todo tasks for the week.
At the end of the week, I will review what I have done and move the undone tasks to the next week.

### Dotted notebook

This notebook is more flexible. The half-first part of the notebook is dedicated to my trackers, reminders and introspective tools.
the second part is dedicated to my journaling, meeting notes, ideas not precisely constructed or organised.

For my trackers I use "year in pixel" to track some habits and help me getting motivated.

For my monthly introspection, I use three question I have to answer: physical, emotional and spiritual. 
And I use also a wheel of life to help me setting the focus for the following month.

I have pages to keep track to follow book, podcast, film, serie I have seen, read or listen.

I have different pages to log:
- some concept I heard about and I want to dig into
- important events that happened
- things i want to try
- things and events that made me happy
- vision board for the year
- ideal day (week and weekend) to help me destress and relax when I am overwhelmed

## Conclusion
let's review this setup in 6 month to see what I still use and what I have changed.

In addition to this setup, I also use the app [Session](https://www.stayinsession.com/) to be more focus on one task only.

Let me know if you have a bullet journal and how you use it, and if you want to see pictures of mine. I would be happy to hear from you.
