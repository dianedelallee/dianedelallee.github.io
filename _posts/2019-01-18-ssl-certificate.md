During the last past years, I have developed several websites and still have to maintain them.
I have done those sites in Django and, I host them in PythonAnywhere.
I use OpenSSL certificates but, those certificates expire quite regularly.

As I am a lazy developer, I do not want to check that by myself and to do manual work. I wrote a python script to do the job for me.

In PythonAnywhere you can schedule tasks quite easily. You need to go to the "Tasks" section, select the frequency and, choose the file you want to run.

This is my script :

```python
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

import os

if __name__ == '__main__':

    web_apps = ["www.website_1.ch", "www.website_2.ch"]
    os.chdir('letsencrypt')

    for app in web_apps:
        bash_command = "echo $(openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in ~/letsencrypt/{}/cert.pem)".format(app)
        process = subprocess.check_output(['bash','-c', bash_command])
        process = process.decode("utf-8")
        process = process.replace('\n', '')
        res = process.split("notAfter=")

        datetime_object = datetime.strptime(res[1], '%b %d %H:%M:%S %Y %Z')
        td = timedelta(days=2)
        delta = datetime_object - td

        if datetime.now() >= delta:    # renew the certificate
            print('We will renew the certificate for {}'.format(app))
            try:
                bash_command_renew_certificate = '~/dehydrated/dehydrated --cron --domain {} --out . --challenge http-01'.format(app)
                bash_command_install_certificate = 'pa_install_webapp_letsencrypt_ssl.py {}'.format(app)
                subprocess.check_output(['bash','-c', bash_command_renew_certificate])
                subprocess.check_output(['bash','-c', bash_command_install_certificate])
                print('Certificate renewed for {}'.format(app))
            except Exception as e:
                print(e)
                print('Certificate not renewed for {}'.format(app))

        else:
            print("The certificate for {} is up to date !".format(app))
            print("It will expired the {}".format(datetime_object))
        print(20*'----')
```
