My name is Diane,

I am a Junior Web Developer working at Pix4D since Nov 2016.

I am continually reading a lot of blogs and articles about how to become a better developer and how to write good code.

Now it is time for me to start writing a blog to help me to have a better understanding of some topics and also keep a trace on my evolution. I hope it helps me to stay focused and up-to-date for some technologies and also to deepen on what I already know.

Time to time, I also appreciate spending hours to solve problems or writing scripts to do not do basic stuff again and again. I hope sharing this knowledge could help others developers.

My work environment

- **Computer:** MacBook Pro 2017
- **IDE:** Pycharm
- **Editor:** Brackets
- **Terminal:** ZSH
- **Git:** GitKraken
- **ToDolist:** TickTick
