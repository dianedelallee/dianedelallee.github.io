## 2021 review
### What I planed to do one year ago

#### Professional

  - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Cancel due to covid and starting a new job with a new language </span>
- ✍🏼 **Write an article** on my blog once a month -> try to write small articles about stuff I discovered at work.
  - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> 7 articles wrote ! not so bad as I started a new job </span>

  - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Read a lot of doc and book about Ruby ! </span>
- 🖥 Improve skills on **Design pattern, and database**
  - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Learn a new language and improve a bit skills about performance and git </span>
- 🧘🏽‍♀️ **Be more rigorous** when I do pull requests and to document new project
  - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Totally done that ! Will write an article about `git rebase` and writing good commit </span>

  - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Achieve that when starting my new job </span>

#### Personal

  - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Achieved that during four first months of the years. Will start it again</span>
- Be able to clean the apartment and do not create lots of bazaars all over the place
  - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> A lot more better than the previous year </span>
- Reduce time spent on some websites where I infinite scroll (Twitter, Linkedin, LeMatin, instagram, youtube, ....)
  - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Achieved ! New job and new role at Le Romandie helps me to loose less time. </span>


### What also happened during the year

At the beginning of the year, all my team was fired, and I needed to found a new job. I had the amazing opportunity to start a new journey
at [QoQa](https://www.qoqa.ch/fr). I needed to learn Ruby and to discover a new way of working. This company is also working according to [holacracy](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacratie) 
system which is fascinating.

I started a new position in the concert club where I volunteer. I am now President, which means I have to take care of the team and be sure all problems/questions are solved.
This new challenge is really exciting especially with the pandemic context. This is for us an amazing time to restructure the team and reinvent ourselves.
