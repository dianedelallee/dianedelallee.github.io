## Why getting feedback regularly
Beginning of the year is still a good moment (for me), to take a break and plan my annual goals.
It is also a nice time to go looking for feedbacks from my peers.

Why? to help me see what are my strength and what are my weaknesses.

If I know what bother my colleagues and what are they thankful for, it will help me setting my goals, 
and change some of my behaviour.

## The format I use

I created a google forms with 8 questions.
I choose 4 colleagues to send this forms. Those colleagues have very different profiles. 
The goals for me is to see how I am perceived from more junior peer, from person that I am technically inspired by, and 
from leader that I respect.

Those persons are the one that I trust to provide me good feedbacks, and with which it is quite easy to talk and 
exchange.

I keep persons with I am less comfortable for my annual review, because the feedback will be more formal at this 
time. Don't know if this is the right choice, will see that in next month.

  
### Why a google form?

I think this is easier for the person to take time to write down their mind and can do that when they are 
emotionally ready.

### My questions

- Do you have in mind a moment where I surprise you in a good way?
- Do you have in mind a moment where you told you "Gasp, She could have done differently/better"?
- According to you, what are my 3 main strength?
- Could you identifier 3 axes for improvement?
- Do you have any advices to improve those previous axes?
- Anything else you want to share
- Would you want me to do the same exercise for you?
- Would you like to discuss that later in real life?
