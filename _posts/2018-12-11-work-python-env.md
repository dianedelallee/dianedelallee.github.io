When you start a new python project, it is quite important to have a proper environment.
With Pipenv, it is quite easy to create a virtual environment, install libraries and manage the version of those libraries.

As I am using Brew, it is easy to install and to use.
Let's see that.

## Installation

`brew install pipenv`

## New project and Pipenv workflow

My new project is in ~/Desktop/development/my_project

`cd ~/Desktop/development/my_project`

I want to create my Pipfile (to know which libraries are installed with which a specific version).

Let's call Pipenv to install the requests library.

`pipenv install requests`

you should see

```shell

To activate this project's virtualenv, run pipenv shell.
Alternatively, run a command inside the virtualenv with pipenv run.
```

If you check you will now have a Pipfile in your repository.
Now, I want to run my virtual env and start to work on my project.

`pipenv shell`

you should see

```shell
Launching subshell in virtual environment‚Ä¶
 . /Users/ddelalle/.local/share/virtualenvs/my_project-5dI9ifch/bin/activate
```

That is it! You now have a proper environment to work.
If you need to exit your virtual env, just write

`exit`

You can find more explanation and more configuration in the [Pipenv project page](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/basics/).
