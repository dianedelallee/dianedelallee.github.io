When you start a new github repo, just create the folder .github and create these three files, to help you in your day-to-day job:

- auto_assign.yml
- pull_request_template.md
- settings.yml

auto_assign.yml

```yml
# Set to true to add reviewers to pull requests
addReviewers: true

# Set to true to add assignees to pull requests
addAssignees: false

# A list of reviewers to be added to pull requests (GitHub user name)
reviewers:
  - user_name_1
  - user_name_2
  - user_name_3

# A number of reviewers added to the pull request
# Set 0 to add all the reviewers (default: 0)
numberOfReviewers: 0
# A list of assignees, overrides reviewers if set
# assignees:
#   - assigneeA

# A number of assignees to add to the pull request
# Set to 0 to add all of the assignees.
# Uses numberOfReviewers if unset.
# numberOfAssignees: 2

# A list of keywords to be skipped the process that add reviewers if pull requests include it
# skipKeywords:
#   - wip
```
