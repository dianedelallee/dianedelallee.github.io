With the new year, comes new resolutions. This year, I have decided to take a lot of resolutions. For some, I have already started them few months ago, but it also a way to continue those new actions in 2020. Here my resolutions for 2020:

## Profesional

- Write an article on my blog twice a month
- Keep an optimistic mindset, stay positive in main situation
- Go to 2 conferences
- Read at least one book relative to Software and Organization by quarter
- Be proactive and not lazy - discover new technologies and get out of my comfort zone

## Personnal

- Go to the gym at least 3 times a week (do that since 4 months)
- Cook my meal for all lunches during the week
- Drink less than one coffee a day
- Do not buy accessories coming from all around the world (lets see if I can do the same for clothes)
- Drink less alcohol during the week (start by ordering small beer instead of large one)
- Do meditation twice a week before sleeping

Now I am ready to start this year on good bases. Lets see if I can do that seriously. üí™üèΩ I will keep you update on those goals
