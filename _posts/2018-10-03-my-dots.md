I have installed different tools on my computer to work well and to have a bit of fun as well.
I have used the package manager called Homebrew to set up my computer. It allows you to install some packages or applications from the command line.

To install Homebrew, just go to your terminal and write:
`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Now you are ready to install your packages or your applications.

For example, if you want to install LibreOffice just write:

`brew cask install libreoffice`

and if you want to install a library

`brew install python`

This is the list of apps I had installed thanks to homebrew.

- alfred
- bitbar
- brackets
- cheatsheet
- bitbar
- docker
- firefox
- flux
- gimp
- gitkraken
- google-chrome
- iterm2
- marp
- menubar-color
- numi
- spectacle
- ticktick

This is the list of package/libraries I had installed:

- ack
- ansiweather
- archey
- battery
- cowsay
- emojify
- fortune
- git
- howdoi
- htop
- httpie
- newsboat
- node
- pipenv
- pycodestyle
- python
- terminal-notifier
- vegeta
- youtube-dl
- zsh
- zsh-completions

Now you have a better environment to work! Let's continue to organize a bit more your terminal.
