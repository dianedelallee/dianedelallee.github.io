It is time for the 2022 review and also to set new goals for 2023.

## 2022 review
### What I planed to do one year ago

#### Professional
- 💎 **Improve Ruby skills** and communication one
    - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Way better in both: speak in two Meetup and in one talk about women in computer science, for ruby less and less comments </span>
- 🖥 **Improve SQL skills**
    - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Start reading documentation and looking for a class - but not a lot of progress </span>
- ✍🏼 **Write an article** on my blog once a month
    - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> only write 3 articles: was focus on other aspects of my works but I have plenty of topics I want to talk about </span>
- 🎙 Go to **1 conference** if covid-19 slow down
    - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Go to a conference about music but some topics can be apply to my job </span>
  
#### Personal
- 📚 Read more **books about leadership**: to help me in my role at Le Romandie
    - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> 2 books read, and one in progress </span>
- Less alcohol 🍺 and coffee ☕ during week
    - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> almost alcohol only during weekend: except stress period and end of year </span>
- 🚶🏽‍♀️Walk at least 5000 steps by day
    - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Did it with even 8200 steps by day in average on the full year </span>
- 📸 Continue to shoot film and improve skill about photography
    - <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> around 1 film each two month - still enjoying that </span>
- 💍 Manage paperwork and organisation about wedding
    -  <span style="color:#007bff; font-weight:bold;"> Married and all paperworks done </span>
