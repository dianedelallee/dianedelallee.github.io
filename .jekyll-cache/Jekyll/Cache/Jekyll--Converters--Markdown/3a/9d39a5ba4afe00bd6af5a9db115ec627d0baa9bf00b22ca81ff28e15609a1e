I",<p>I am working at <strong>Pix4D</strong> for a bit more than 2 years now and, it is time for me to analyze my evolution.</p>

<h2 id="two-years-ago">Two years ago</h2>

<p>When I started at Pix4D, my Github knowledge was very poor, I was not really familiar with Django, never play for Angular, never heard about Ansible, Jenkins</p>

<h2 id="now">Now</h2>

<p>Now, I am really familiar with <strong>Django</strong> (taking care of all the update of our libraries - migrations from Django 1.11 to 2.8), I am happy to help my front end colleagues on <strong>Angular</strong> project: developed some small features, wrote some <strong>end-to-end</strong> tests I am definitively more confident to play with <strong>GitHub</strong> (rebase, stash, reset, â€¦). I am also really happy to taking care and be in charge of some projects in the company. I have also play a bit with <strong>No-SQL DB</strong> (DynamoDb), Marshmarllow and Falcon</p>

<h2 id="in-the-future">In the Future</h2>

<p>For the next year, I would like to improve my python advanced skills (security and performance), but I also would like to focus on improving my skills about containers (ex: Docker) and continuous deployment. Continue to help and play with front-end is also something that I would like to continue and finally, I would like to increase my skills on leading/managing project.
I am looking forward to see what 2020 will be going on the professionnal side</p>

<p>Here is the evolution of my github contributions:</p>
