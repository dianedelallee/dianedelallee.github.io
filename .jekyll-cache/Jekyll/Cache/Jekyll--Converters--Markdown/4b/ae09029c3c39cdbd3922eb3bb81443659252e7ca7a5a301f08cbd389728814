I"@<p>My name is Diane,</p>

<p>I am a Junior Web Developer working at Pix4D since Nov 2016.</p>

<p>I am continually reading a lot of blogs and articles about how to become a better developer and how to write good code.</p>

<p>Now it is time for me to start writing a blog to help me to have a better understanding of some topics and also keep a trace on my evolution. I hope it helps me to stay focused and up-to-date for some technologies and also to deepen on what I already know.</p>

<p>Time to time, I also appreciate spending hours to solve problems or writing scripts to do not do basic stuff again and again. I hope sharing this knowledge could help others developers.</p>
